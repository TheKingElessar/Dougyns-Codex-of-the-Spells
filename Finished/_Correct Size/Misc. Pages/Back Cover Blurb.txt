Dougyn Mudthrower's adventures have taken him across nations, between planets, and through planes. He has toppled giants, frozen dragons, and incinerated raiders.

Throughout it all, he has striven for the collection and distribution of knowledge, particularily of the arcane. Though his libraries may meet unorthodox fates, being trapped in time or pilfered by invaders, the wizard Dougyn continues his mission to spread the arts.

This spell compendium is his crowning achievement. Stopped by no bias, foiled by no enemy, and thwarted by no obscurity, Dougyn has gathered every piece of spellcasting knowledge ever known to ecreon, man, or gnome.

Learn it well, and this tome may save your life.
