There are two verions of the PDF:
 - The full, uncompressed version. That's about 1.5 GB.
 - A compressed, optimized version. That's about 350 MB. This one is small enough to upload to Lulu.
 
 To download one of the PDFs, you'll need to download each of the corresponding `.tar.00*` files. Each will be 99 MB. Then, extract the first one with [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/).

Things to fix:
 - Mass Heal (push on to next column, then cut out that page from finished PDF and reform it)
 - Maybe change back cover to have Player's Handbook and Xanathar's Guide to Everything instead of the three core books
