At this point all of the processing and scripts should be complete; now it's just down to the editing.

### Historical Notes

When I made the first version of this eight months ago, there were several significant problems, and they all stemmed from one thing: the page size. D&D sourcebooks are 8.25"x10.75", and GMBinder can't export a PDF in that size, so each page had to be a seperate image. The full PDF size was massive. It was pretty hard to find a printer to print in that size, too.

Overall, this letter-sized version will solve those problems, at the expense of not being the exact same size as the official sourcebooks. I think it's worth it.

To see the old version, you can check out the old [master branch here](https://github.com/TheKingElessar/Dougyns-Codex-of-the-Spells/tree/master).
